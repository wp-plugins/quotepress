== Description ==

QuotePress allows you to easily manage and display your own quotes collection in WordPress.
Quotes are kept in a separate WordPress page type, making it easy to search, sort, archive, delete, and manage the quotes.
The Quotes are fully searchable by the built-in WordPress search engine.
Both shortcode (in-page/in-post) interfaces as well as widgets (sidebars, footers, etc.) are available.

= Features =

* **Quote Page Type** - adds a custom WordPress "quote" to the admin panel.
   * Quotes have their own categories (taxonomy).
   * Quotes are fully searchable from within the main WordPres search.
   * Uses the standard search/sort/add/delete and bulk manager you are used to for pages and posts.
* **Shortcodes** - put quotes in your pages and posts with ease.
   * [quotepress list="25"] list the most recent 25 quotes
   * [quotepress id="123"] show quote #123
   * [quotepress label="feel-lucky"] show qoute with the "feel-lucky" label.
* **Widgets Included** - put quotes in your sidebar, footers, home page.  Anywhere widgets are supported.
* Localization and Internationalization supported, send us your translation (pot) files.

= Premium Add-Ons =

Premium add-on packages have not yet been developed for this plugin, however I do accept and appreciate donations.

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [WordPress Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/adpress).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [CSA Product Documentation](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/customization/).

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every couple of months.   I have multiple plugins and limited time and focus on the plugins that get the most feedback and input from users.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.
If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support me and encourage even more items get added the next time around.


= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs.
In my opinion, well-written plugins are few and far between.
While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have too many hidden problems.
I have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings.
While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked.
The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During 20+ years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road.
Warnings today often become errors tomorrow.
Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages.
Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow".
Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be.
My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast.
If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.
To sum it all up, I like to write plugins that last.
I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/quotepress/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/qyotepress) here at WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why Another Quotes Plugin? =   

We tried a few.  A bunch actually.   But none had all the features we need. The two main features we needed on day one? Having quotes show up in the main search results. Widgets. Some plugins had searchable quotes.  Some had widgets.   None, that worked with that latest version of WordPress, had both.   After literally a dozen we stopped looking and wrote our own.  It was faster.

= How do I report a bug? =

Post in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/adpress).
You can also [contact me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support) to request premium support if you need immediate assistance.

= What are the premium add-ons? =

In response to feature requests from customers, I created a series of premium add-on packages for my plugins.
These features extend the functionality of the plugin beyond the basic service and features and can be purchased ala-carte.
This gives those customers who want more out of the plugin the extra features they desire while keeping the main plugin as
efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to my efforts.

Current premium add-ons:

* None for QuotePress at this time.

= Who is Charleston Software Associates? =

Currently it is one guy hacking code in a home office.
I ONLY do mobile apps and WordPress plugins for a living.
Lately it has been almost exclusively work on Store Locator Plus due to the popularity and requests for added features that come in every month.

= What are the terms of the license? =

The license is GPL.  You get the code, feel free to modify it as you
wish. I prefer that customers pay because they like what I do and

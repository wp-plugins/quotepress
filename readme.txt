== Description ==

QuotePress allows you to easily manage and display your own quotes collection in WordPress.
Quotes are kept in a separate WordPress page type, making it easy to search, sort, archive, delete, and manage the quotes.
The Quotes are fully searchable by the built-in WordPress search engine.
Both shortcode (in-page/in-post) interfaces as well as widgets (sidebars, footers, etc.) are available.

= Features =

* **Quote Page Type** - adds a custom WordPress "quote" to the admin panel.
   * Quotes have their own categories (taxonomy).
   * Quotes are fully searchable from within the main WordPres search.
   * Uses the standard search/sort/add/delete and bulk manager you are used to for pages and posts.
* **Shortcodes** - put quotes in your pages and posts with ease.
   * [quotepress list="25"] list the most recent 25 quotes
   * [quotepress id="123"] show quote #123
   * [quotepress label="feel-lucky"] show qoute with the "feel-lucky" label.
* **Widgets Included** - put quotes in your sidebar, footers, home page.  Anywhere widgets are supported.
* Localizization and Internationalization supported, send us your translation (pot) files.
 
= Our Philosophy =

Like all of our plugins, we strive to create code the runs efficiently and without bugs. We feel well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have way to many hidden problems. We have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when we turn off the "hide all the problems" settings in PHP.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings on most web hosts. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During our 20+ years of software development, we have also found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages. Some warnings are also telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

While our plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, we do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. To sum it all up, we like to write plugins that last. We hope you appreciate our work.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why Another Quotes Plugin? =   

We tried a few.  A bunch actually.   But none had all the features we need. The two main features we needed on day one? Having quotes show up in the main search results. Widgets. Some plugins had searchable quotes.  Some had widgets.   None, that worked with that latest version of WordPress, had both.   After literally a dozen we stopped looking and wrote our own.  It was faster.
